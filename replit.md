# Solana Trading Bot Replit Project

## Overview

This is a full-stack Solana trading bot application built with React, TypeScript, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. The system monitors new tokens on Solana DEXs (like PumpFun), executes automated trading strategies, and provides a comprehensive dashboard for backtesting and live monitoring.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Charts**: Chart.js for performance visualization
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js with middleware for logging and error handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Real-time**: Polling-based monitoring system
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses

### Database Schema
- **Trading Parameters**: Configuration for bot behavior (thresholds, position sizes, etc.)
- **Tokens**: Tracked tokens with market data and status
- **Trades**: Historical trade records with P&L calculations
- **Alerts**: System notifications and warnings
- **Backtest Results**: Performance metrics from strategy testing

## Key Components

- **Visualization**: Equity curves and trade analysis

## Data Flow

1. **Token Discovery**: DEX APIs provide new token listings
2. **Filtering**: Tokens are filtered based on configured parameters
3. **Monitoring**: Qualifying tokens are added to watch list
4. **Trading Logic**: Automated buy/sell decisions based on market conditions
5. **Position Tracking**: Active trades are monitored for exit conditions
6. **Data Storage**: All activities are logged to PostgreSQL database
7. **Dashboard Updates**: Real-time UI updates via polling
