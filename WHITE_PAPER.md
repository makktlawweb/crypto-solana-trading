## Problem Statement

### Current Market Failures

1. **High Costs**: Existing platforms charge $150-500/month for basic wallet monitoring
2. **API Dependencies**: Third-party data providers create bottlenecks and recurring costs
3. **Delayed Data**: 5-15 second delays miss critical trading opportunities
4. **Limited Transparency**: Black-box algorithms without performance verification
5. **Platform Risk**: Centralized copy trading platforms control user funds

### Trader Pain Points

- **Information Asymmetry**: Profitable traders identified too late
- **Manual Monitoring**: Tracking multiple wallets requires constant attention
- **Execution Speed**: Human reaction times miss millisecond opportunities
- **Risk Management**: No automated position sizing or stop-loss mechanisms
- **Historical Analysis**: Limited access to wallet performance data
